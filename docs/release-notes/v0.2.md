# Release v0.2

## Changelog for [v0.2.0](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/releases/v0.2.0) - 2020-02-13

### Notable changes

* [#34](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/issue/34) & [#35](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/issue/35) **Clusters can be scaled up and down**

  Etcd clusters can be [scaled up](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/blob/master/docs/operations.md#scale-up-a-cluster) or [down](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/blob/master/docs/operations.md#scale-down-a-cluster) by modifying the `.spec.replicas` field in the `EtcdCluster` resource.
  You can also use `kubectl scale` to do this. 

* [#145](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/145) **Perform version upgrade by rolling update of peers**

  The `EtcdCluster` resource now has a `.spec.version` field for specifying the version of etcd to use.
  If the field is [updated to a higher value](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/blob/master/docs/operations.md#upgrade-a-cluster), the operator will perform a rolling version upgrade.

* [#136](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/136) **EtcdCluster supports specifying affinity in pod template**

  The `EtcdCluster` resource now has a `.spec.podTemplate.affinity` field for specifying affinity rules on the underlying etcd pods.
  This allows users to enforce rules such as scheduling each etcd pod on a different host to enable high-availability clusters.

* [#125](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/125) **Set resource requests and limits on Etcd peer containers**

  The `EtcdCluster` resource now has a `.spec.podTemplate.resources` field for specifying resource requests and limits on the underlying etcd pods.
  This allows users to control how much resources the etcd pods can use.

* [#110](https://github.com/improbable-eng/etcd-cluster-operator/pull/110) **Support passing annotations through to the underlying pods**

  The `EtcdCluster` resource now has a `.spec.podTemplate.metadata.annotations` field for specifying annotations to be passed through to the underlying etcd pods.
  These annotations can be used to setup scraping of metrics from the etcd pods with Prometheus.
